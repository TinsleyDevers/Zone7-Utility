**Zone7 Utility [1.20.X] Pet Mobs - Poke Users - Discord Command - Tips in Chat

This is my first real java project and it was made for the minecraft server zone7.apexmc.co

Allows you to pet mobs by shift right clicking with an empty hand.

Also includes:

**/discord** - showcase your discord

**/poke** {player} - plays an audible ding for the user and lets them know they've been poked/mentioned.

**/tips** - enable or disable tips to be shown in chat every hour to players fully customizable
